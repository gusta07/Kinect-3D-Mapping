#3D mapping of the lymphatic system using infrared light

This Master Thesis consisted of making a proof of concept for a novel 3D imaging tool. In short, a Kinect will scan the environment and obtain a 3D model of it. At the same time, an external camera (later replaced by an infrared camera) will take pictures of specific details of the scene. The pictures will be mapped on the 3D surface at the correct locations.
