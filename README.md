MASTER THESIS

"3D mapping of the lymphatic system using infrared light"

This Master Thesis consisted of making a proof of concept for a novel 3D imaging tool. In short, a Kinect will scan the environment and obtain a 3D model of it. At the same time, an external camera (later replaced by an infrared camera) will take pictures of specific details of the scene. After that, the pictures will be mapped on the 3D surface at the correct locations. 

All the information can be found in the .pdf and the different source codes used can also be found in the different folders.
