	abstract = {{BACKGROUND:} Sentinel lymph node ({SLN)} biopsy with radioisotope and blue dye has been used successfully for axillary staging in breast cancer. This study evaluated the feasibility of fluorescence detection of {SLNs} with indocyanine green ({ICG)} for lymphatic mapping and {SLN} biopsy.
{METHODS:} Thirty women with breast cancer had a periareolar injection of {ICG} for fluorescence detection of {SLN} using a near-infrared camera. Twenty also received ({99m)Tc-labelled} sulphur radiocolloid for {SLN} scintigraphy. All patients underwent axillary lymph node dissection. Detection rate and sensitivity of both methods were the study endpoints.
{RESULTS:} Visualization of lymphatic vessels by fluorescence detection depended on the dose of {ICG.} {ICG} imaging identified {SLNs} in 29 of 30 women (detection rate 97 per cent). Nineteen of 21 patients had metastatic {SLN} involvement (sensitivity 90 per cent) with false-negative results in two. Among the 20 patients who had both methods, {ICG} fluorescence and radiocolloid identified {SLNs} in 20 and 17 patients respectively. Metastatic lymph nodes were diagnosed in 12 and ten of 13 patients (sensitivity 92 and 77 per cent). False-negative rates were 8 and 23 per cent respectively.
{CONCLUSION:} {ICG} fluorescence allowed transcutaneous imaging of lymphatic vessels and {SLN} detection, thus combining the advantages of radioisotope and blue dye methods.},

This device consists of a combination of custom-made optical filters and an ultra-high sensitive {CCD} image sensor, which can detect simultaneously color and near-infrared ({NIR)} rays from 380 to 1200 nm. We showed a comparison between our system and other devices for the preliminary experience. We routinely performed both transit-time flowmetry ({TFM)} and color images for intraoperative assessment, thallium-scintigraphy for the early postoperative assessment, and then angiography after 1-year surgery. We also obtained intraoperative graft flows and images in 116 grafts. Although {TFM} indicated a graft patency, the {CCD} camera suspected perfusion failures in four grafts. Also the analysis of the {ICG} fluorescence intensity showed the significant hypoperfusion at the perfusion territory distal to the anastomosis (graft vs. perfusion territory; 230±26 vs. 156±13 a.u, P=0.02). When the {CCD} camera suspected a graft failure, {CCD} camera and angiography showed a comparable graft failure. The unique device that visualized {ICG-enhanced} structures against a background of natural myocardial color improved the visibility of abnormality in flow and perfusion. Our findings show that this device may become a standard intraoperative graft and perfusion assessment tool in coronary artery bypass graft ({CABG).}},

	abstract = {The lymphatic system is a complex network of lymph vessels, lymphatic organs and lymph nodes. Traditionally, imaging of the lymphatic system has been based on conventional imaging methods like computed tomography ({CT)} and magnetic resonance imaging ({MRI)}, whereby enlargement of lymph nodes is considered the primary diagnostic criterion for disease. This is particularly true in oncology, where nodal enlargement can be indicative of nodal metastases or lymphoma. {CT} and {MRI} on their own are, however, anatomical imaging methods. Newer imaging methods such as positron emission tomography ({PET)}, dynamic contrast-enhanced {MRI} ({DCE-MRI)} and color Doppler ultrasound ({CDUS)} provide a functional assessment of node status. None of these techniques is capable of detecting flow within the lymphatics and, thus, several intra-lymphatic imaging methods have been developed. Direct lymphangiography is an all-but-extinct method of visualizing the lymphatic drainage from an extremity using oil-based iodine contrast agents. More recently, interstitially injected intra-lymphatic imaging, such as lymphoscintigraphy, has been used for lymphedema assessment and sentinel node detection. Nevertheless, radionuclide-based imaging has the disadvantage of poor resolution. This has lead to the development of novel systemic and interstitial imaging techniques which are minimally invasive and have the potential to provide both structural and functional information; this is a particular advantage for cancer imaging, where anatomical depiction alone often provides insufficient information. At present the respective role each modality plays remains to be determined. Indeed, multi-modal imaging may be more appropriate for certain lymphatic disorders. The field of lymphatic imaging is ever evolving, and technological advances, combined with the development of new contrast agents, continue to improve diagnostic accuracy.

However, the number of lymphographic studies performed in oncology centers has declined markedly since the introduction of cross-sectional imaging techniques, especially computed tomography ({CT).} Therefore, levels of expertise in both performing lymphography and interpreting lymphograms are falling. The unique ability of lymphography to demonstrate derangements of the internal architecture of normal-sized lymph nodes can be valuable and makes it more accurate than {CT} in evaluation of some lymphomas (especially Hodgkin disease) and genitourinary malignancies. In fact, lymphography and {CT} are complementary rather than mutually exclusive techniques for the staging of some lymphomas and genitourinary malignancies. In addition, lymphography opacifies the lymphatic channels and therefore may be a valuable tool for detection of lymphatic fistulas or lymphatic leakage. Finally, lymphography helps guide subsequent therapy in patients with lymphomas, genitourinary malignancies, or disorders of lymphatic flow.},

	abstract = {Purpose: To prospectively demonstrate the feasibility of using indocyanine green, a near-infrared ({NIR)} fluorophore at the minimum dose needed for noninvasive optical imaging of lymph nodes ({LNs)} in breast cancer patients undergoing sentinel lymph node mapping ({SLNM).}
Materials and Methods: Informed consent was obtained from 24 women (age range, 30–85 years) who received intradermal subcutaneous injections of 0.31–100 μg indocyanine green in the breast in this {IRB-approved}, {HIPAA-compliant}, dose escalation study to find the minimum microdose for imaging. The breast, axilla, and sternum were illuminated with {NIR} light and the fluorescence generated in the tissue was collected with an {NIR-sensitive} intensified charged-coupled device. Lymphoscintigraphy was also performed. Resected {LNs} were evaluated for the presence of radioactivity, blue dye accumulation, and fluorescence. The associations between the resected {LNs} that were fluorescent and (a) the time elapsed between {NIR} fluorophore administration and resection and (b) the dosage of {NIR} fluorophores were tested with the Spearman rank and Pearson product moment correlation tests, respectively.
Results: Lymph imaging consistently failed with indocyanine green microdosages between 0.31 and 0.77 μg. When indocyanine green dosages were 10 μg or higher, lymph drainage pathways from the injection site to {LNs} were imaged in eight of nine women; lymph propulsion was observed in seven of those eight. When propulsion in the breast and axilla regions was present, the mean apparent velocities ranged from 0.08 to 0.32 cm/sec, the time elapsed between “packets” of propelled fluid varied from 14 to 92 seconds. In patients who received 10 μg of indocyanine green or more, a weak negative correlation between the fluorescence status of resected {LNs} and the time between {NIR} fluorophore administration and {LN} resection was found. No statistical association was found between the fluorescence status of resected {LNs} and the dose of {NIR} fluorophore.
Conclusion: {NIR} fluorescence imaging of lymph function and {LNs} is feasible in humans at microdoses that would be needed for future molecular imaging of cancer-positive {LNs.}

{MATERIALS} {AND} {METHODS:} Before radical hysterectomy and pelvic lymphadenectomy in 35 patients with International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics stage {IB} or {II} cervical cancer, abdominal {FDG-PET} and {MR} imaging were performed. Malignancy criteria were a lymph node diameter of 1 cm or more at {MR} imaging and a focally increased {FDG} uptake at {PET.} The findings of {FDG-PET} and {MR} imaging were compared with histologic findings.
{RESULTS:} Histologic examination revealed {pN0-stage} cancer in 24 patients and {pN1-stage} cancer in 11 patients. On a patient basis, node staging resulted in sensitivities of 0.91 with {FDG-PET} and 0.73 with {MR} imaging and specificities of 1.00 with {FDG-PET} and 0.83 with {MR} imaging. The positive predictive value ({PPV)} of {FDG-PET} was 1.00 and that of {MR} imaging, 0.67 (not significant). The metastatic involvement of lymph node sites was identified at {FDG-PET} with a {PPV} of 0.90; at {MR} imaging, 0.64 (P {\textless} .05, Fisher exact test).

Three main technical advances, however, have recently completed the clinical armamentarium for lymph node imaging: first, the refinement of cross sectional imaging, i.e. {CT} and {MRI}, combined or not with dedicated contrast agents, has progressively replaced conventional lymphography in oncology situations; second, the development of intra-operative sentinel node mapping has profoundly modified the diagnostic and therapeutic procedures in several cancer situations, mostly melanoma and breast cancer; finally, the increased availability of functional imaging, especially through the use of {FDG-PET}, has greatly contributed to the accuracy improvement of nodal metastases identification. The aim of this review will thus be to briefly review the anatomy and physiology of the lymphatic systems and to overview the basic principles of up-to-date lymph node imaging.},

	volume = {12},

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND:} Sentinel lymph node biopsy using a vital dye is a convenient and safe method to assess lymph node status in breast cancer. However, intensive training is necessary to obtain a satisfactory detection rate and to avoid false-negative results. This paper presents a novel method using indocyanine green fluorescence imaging to detect sentinel lymph nodes.
{METHODS:} Fluorescence images were obtained using a charge coupled device camera with a cut filter as the detector, and light emitting diodes at 760 nm as the light source. When indocyanine green was injected around the areola, subcutaneous lymphatic channels draining from the areola to the axilla were visible by fluorescence within a few minutes. The sentinel lymph node was then dissected by fluorescence navigation.
{RESULTS:} Sentinel lymph node biopsy using the present method was performed on eighteen patients. Subcutaneous lymphatics were detectable by fluorescence in all patients, and sentinel nodes were successfully identified in 17 of 18 cases (detection rate:94\%). It was possible to detect the lymphatic channels and nodes receiving indocyanine green with higher sensitivity by the fluorescence signal than by the green color.
{CONCLUSION:} Sentinel node biopsy guided by indocyanine green fluorescence imaging is a promising technique for further clinical exploration.},
